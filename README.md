# RAMP starting kit on Mechanics Determination

The goal of this challenge is to find ways to simulate the theoretical model finding process in physics or similar sciences. A good example is the paradigm shift between the Ptolemy and Copernican models of the solar system.

In the challenge we start by putting ourselves in Ptolemy's shoes, approach the same problem in imaginary systems in which the motion of the objects in the sky could have completely different underlying mechanics that we don't know of.

#### Set up

Open a terminal and

1. install the `ramp-workflow` library (if not already done)
  ```
  $ pip install git+https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow.git
  ```
  
2. Follow the ramp-kits instructions from the [wiki](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/wiki/Getting-started-with-a-ramp-kit)

#### Local notebook

Get started on this RAMP with the [dedicated notebook](mechanics_starting_kit.ipynb).

#### Help
Go to the `ramp-workflow` [wiki](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/wiki) for more help on the [RAMP](http:www.ramp.studio) ecosystem.
